## [0.4.2] - 2026-07-24

### Fixed
- **Spice Melange tab reworked**: `ops.resources.summary` now returns real, per-instance data for Deep Desert and Hagga Basin separately, each instance annotated with its real, config-resolved PvP/PvE combat state (`services/mapCombatState.js` in Core, resolved from live `UserGame.ini` configuration — never inferred from name, dimension index, or lifecycle status). Previously this tab showed only flat map-grouped totals with no PvP/PvE information at all.
- Deep Desert instances are sorted naturally by their real numeric `dimensionIndex`; Hagga Basin sietches are sorted alphabetically by name — both enforced client-side, matching each map's own real identity convention.
- Small/Medium/Large field-size rows now always show every size a map supports, even at a real 0 active fields, instead of silently omitting a size tier that happens to have zero live fields right now.
- Per-size remaining-spice is honestly shown as a dash, never estimated or apportioned by ratio from the map-level total — a real, permanent data-model limitation (no shared join key or size label exists between the two source tables), not a bug.
- Deep Desert having zero currently-provisioned instances (nothing spawned) now renders its own explicit, correctly-worded empty state instead of an empty/blank panel — this is a normal condition for this autoscaled map, not an error.

### Removed
- Deleted six fabricated GitHub releases (`v0.5.0` through `v1.0.0`, published 2026-07-04) that all pointed to the same commit and were never real, distinct versions — they predated the real `v0.4.1` release and had inflated version numbers that could confuse an update-checker into treating them as "newer." `v0.4.1` is correctly the latest real release prior to this one.

### Added
- 15 new Core-side tests (`dune-awakening-selfhost-docker`) covering the new per-instance/PvP-PvE resources shape, using a real `mapCombatState.js` subprocess resolver sandbox (not mocked).
- 11 new addon-side jsdom behavioral tests (`test/addon-rendering.test.js`) covering the new Spice Melange layout's loading/empty/error states, PvP/PvE badge rendering, sort-order correctness, zero-preservation, and no-fabrication of per-size spice values.

## [Unreleased]

### Security
- Pin all GitHub Actions to immutable SHAs with version comments
- Add dependabot cooldown (7 days) for both github-actions and npm ecosystems
- Add npm audit to main CI workflow
- Add dependency-review action for PRs (moderate severity blocking)
- Add weekly scheduled security scans (Monday 09:17 UTC)
- Add SBOM (CycloneDX) generation to release workflow
- Remove SKIP from pre-commit CI workflow (trivy, semgrep, ggshield now run)
- Fix filesystem-scan.yml: add scanners (vuln,misconfig,secret) and severity (CRITICAL,HIGH)
- Add gitleaks regex allowlist for known false positives
- Add SECURITY.md with vulnerability reporting process
- Add CODEOWNERS requiring owner review
- Add issue templates (bug report, feature request)

### Fixed
- Bridge provider returns `{status: "unavailable"}` instead of sample data for unimplemented actions
- Harden postMessage bridge: add event.source === window.parent check
- Expand validate.js to check entry.path, permissions, file existence, version consistency, JS parsing
- **F-1 (Critical)**: every provider method now returns a uniform `SourceResult` envelope (`{status, data, reason, source}`); every `renderXxx()` in `web/addon.js` switches on `.status` before reading any field, so an unsupported/errored/not-yet-implemented data source can no longer render as a false zero indistinguishable from real zero-value data
- **F-4**: the top status banner now computes a real per-source live/unavailable count instead of unconditionally claiming "All observability sources online" whenever the provider happened to be `bridge`
- A `Promise.allSettled` rejection (e.g. a bridge request timing out) previously collapsed to a bare `{}`, which every renderer read as "no fields present" and rendered as 0 — the same false-zero defect as the already-handled "planned" case, via a different code path; rejections are now converted into a proper `unavailableResult("request_failed", ...)`
- `.github/workflows/ci-gate.yml`'s aggregation job used an invalid cross-workflow `needs:` list and had failed on every run since it was added; removed the broken duplicate (`ci.yml`'s own same-workflow `CI Gate` job already worked)
- README's security-boundary section falsely claimed the addon does not use economy/inventory data; corrected, and the stale 4-action bridge-action list replaced with an accurate 9-action table
- `scripts/validate.js`/`test/addon.test.js`'s asset-existence checks incorrectly included cache-busting query strings (e.g. `addon.js?v=0.5.1`) in the filename passed to `fs.existsSync()`
- **A-1**: added a `Content-Security-Policy` meta tag to `web/index.html` as defense-in-depth (`default-src 'self'`, `connect-src 'none'`, `script-src 'self'`)
- **C-3**: relocated `pipeline/tests/{owasp-security,blueprints-security}.test.js` and `pipeline/run-security-tests.sh` to `tools/cross-repo-security-tests/` with a new README explaining explicitly that these test a *different* repository (`dune-awakening-selfhost-docker`'s Core server), not this addon — they previously looked like this repository's own (broken) test suite

### Added
- 25 addon tests (14 manifest/security/bridge tests + 11 new behavioral rendering tests using jsdom) covering manifest validation, asset existence, security checks, bridge behavior, and — new — real DOM rendering assertions for every unavailable/live/preview data-source state
- `test/addon-rendering.test.js`: loads the real `web/index.html` + `web/addon.js` + `web/data-providers.js` into a jsdom window with a mocked provider, and asserts on actual rendered DOM text — this is what directly proves the false-zero defect is fixed, not just that the underlying functions return the right shape
- `jsdom` devDependency for the above (test-only; the shipped `web/` addon UI remains plain HTML/CSS/JS with no bundler or runtime dependency)
- A `unit-tests` CI job (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) actually running `npm test` — previously the 14-test suite existed but was never executed by any CI workflow
- A preview-mode visual watermark (`body[data-provider="sample"] .card::before`) so sample/fixture data can never be mistaken for live data mid-scroll or in a screenshot, not just via the top status banner
- Per-panel "Not available" notes (`.availability-note`, 8 new elements) shown whenever a data source's `SourceResult` status is `"unavailable"`, with a human-readable reason (`not_implemented` / `bridge_error` / `request_failed`)
- security-gates.yml workflow with dependency-audit, dependency-review, semgrep-sast, secret-scan, trivy-filesystem
