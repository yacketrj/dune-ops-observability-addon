# Dune Ops Observability — Comprehensive Roadmap

**Status**: Draft v1.0
**Date**: 2026-07-04
**Repository**: `yacketrj/dune-ops-observability-addon`
**Canonical branch**: `main`

---

## 1. Overview

Dune Ops Observability is a publicly listed community addon for Red-Blink's Dune: Awakening self-hosted Docker server. It combines three tracks into a single operator-facing product:

1. **SOC/OPS monitoring** — platform health, service lifecycle, data freshness, capacity saturation, authentication posture.
2. **Game telemetry** — read-only aggregate analytics across players, combat, economy, resources, and world activity.
3. **Release governance** — formal 5-gate release process, SOC2-style audit evidence, SBOM generation, and metric classification before exposure.

The Core (`dune-awakening-selfhost-docker`) provides the infrastructure (Prometheus, exporters, HTTP API, addon bridge actions). The Addon (`dune-ops-observability-addon`) provides the operator-facing panels, dashboards, and analytics UI rendered inside the Dune Docker Console iframe.

This document is the single unified entry point. Detailed standards and per-release specifications are linked from Section 10.

## 5. Dependency Graph

![Release Dependency Graph](diagrams/dependencies.png)

```
Core R1 ──► R2 (Grafana+Alertmanager) ──► R3 (bridge) ──► R4 (SOC) ──► R5 (maturity)
(done)         │                            │               │
               ├───────────────────────────┐│               │
               ▼                           ▼▼               ▼
          v0.3 (done)                 v0.4 (activity+NOC) v0.7 (needs R3+R4)
          v0.4 (activity+NOC)         v0.5 (economy)
                                      v0.6 (world/assets)
```

**Key dependencies (red dashed lines)**:
- **R2 → v0.4**: Grafana + Alertmanager enable operator visibility into game telemetry and NOC dashboard
- **R3 → v0.7**: `metrics.query` bridge action allows v0.7 addon to display Prometheus data (CPU, memory, saturation, bridge reliability)
- **R4 → v0.7**: Persistent rate limits and per-addon CSP are required before v0.7 exposes SOC/OPS controls publicly

---

## 6. Database Discovery Phase

Before implementing any game-facing metric in v0.4–v0.6, a PostgreSQL event inventory must be run against the running `dune-postgres` container. This is a mandatory gate, not optional.

**Required output** (per `DATABASE-EVENT-INVENTORY.md`):
- Available schemas, tables, views, columns with types
- Candidate event/audit/activity tables
- Timestamp coverage and retention windows
- Estimated row counts
- Metric-source mapping: name → schema.table → columns → aggregation window → cardinality risk → privacy class

**Current discovery findings** (per `METRIC-DISCOVERY-FINDINGS.md`):
- Immediately available: player state (`playerconnectionstatus`, `characterstate`), farm state (total, ready, alive, connected players, S2S), inventory counts (79 items, 34 inventories), resource field state (27 entries), marker/location data (41 markers)
- Blocked (zero rows): `game_events`, `event_log`, `dune_exchange_orders`, `dune_exchange_fulfilled_orders`
- Approved safe aggregate candidates: player status summary (online/life/character counts), farm aggregate (total/ready/alive/S2S)

**Hard rule**: No economy, combat, death, NPC, resource, crafting, inventory, market, or location metric enters a release until its source table and columns are confirmed through a documented inventory.

**Sources**: `BRANCHING.md:1-17`, `RELEASE-CADENCE.md:24-29`, `PACKAGING.md`

### Tag Creation Flow

```
1. All tests + security scans pass on feature branch
2. Feature merged to main
3. Release evidence assembled (16-file bundle per release-standard.md)
4. git tag -a v{major}.{minor}.{patch} -m "Release description"
5. git push origin --tags
6. Package build → GitHub Release → SHA-256 verification
7. Catalog manifest updated → upstream PR submitted
```

---

## 8. Release Cadence

| Track | Cadence | Gate | Output |
|---|---|---|---|
| Addon internal PRs | ≤ daily (focused) | PR gates (16 checkpoints) | Feature branch merge |
| Addon public releases | ≤ every 2 weeks | 5-gate release process | GitHub Release + catalog PR |
| Core releases (fork) | Batched by capability block (R1→R5) | Core CI + e2e | Feature tag + upstream PR |
| Upstream Core PRs | After fork validation | Narrow scope, evidence-backed | Red-Blink upstream PR |
| Emergency patches | Allowed | Manifest, security review | Immediate release |

**Versioning** (semver):
- **PATCH**: bug fix, package fix, manifest fix, safe UI correction
- **MINOR**: new panel, read-only feature, operator workflow
- **MAJOR**: permission expansion, breaking manifest, incompatible bridge contract

**Sources**: `RELEASE-CADENCE.md:3-87`, `release-standard.md:13-191`

## 9. Decision Log

| Decision | Date | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| v0.4-v0.7 grouped into 4 releases | 2026-07-04 | v0.4=activity+NOC (combat deferred), v0.5=economy+resources, v0.6=world+assets, v0.7=SOC/OPS. Reduces release count, avoids skipped version. |
| Grafana always-on when addon is running | 2026-07-04 | Operators need persistent access to platform metrics. Grafana binds localhost by default, same posture as Prometheus. |
| Alertmanager supports email + webhook | 2026-07-04 | Email for basic notification; webhook (Discord/Slack) for team ops. Either or both can be configured. |
| Redis acceptable for persistent rate limiting | 2026-07-04 | Redis is a small, well-understood container dependency. Acceptable trade-off for persistent rate limiting over in-memory-only. |
| v1.0.0 waits for Core R3+R4 | 2026-07-04 | v1.0 requires `metrics.query` bridge (R3) and persistent rate limits + CSP (R4). Cannot ship the Operations Center without these dependencies. |
| Addon remains addon-first | 2026-06-30 | Per RFC Addendum: addon owns UI, dashboards, analytics. Core owns bridge actions, infrastructure, upstream PRs. No observability features in Core Web UI. |
| PostgreSQL DB discovery mandatory before game metrics | 2026-07-02 | Per `DATABASE-EVENT-INVENTORY.md` hard rule: no metric enters a release until its source table/columns are confirmed through inventory. |
| Release evidence bundle required per release | 2026-06-30 | Per `release-standard.md`: 16-file evidence bundle, 5-gate process, SOC2-style controls, signed release decision. |
